# Rocket League Offset

This is my offset finder for Rocket League, built using info from various UC posts. Hopefully, this helps others who need it. 

## How It Works
- Scans Rocket League's memory for `GNames` and `GObjects` offsets.
- Uses multiple pattern sets for redundancy.
- Tries different methods to locate the offsets in case one fails. (yes i am kinda randomly finding them but it works so who cares)
